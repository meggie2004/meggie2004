**                                   🤯 🦋 Hey, I'm Maria Gabriella Sica ✨🌙**

📚 I'm currently enrolled at Apple Developer Academy and at the University of Naples federico II, robotics engineering.

The experience at the Apple Developer Academy trained me from a human and professional point of view, allowing me to apply the notions studied at the university; it gave me basics of design and improved my team building, critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

👩🏼‍💻 I'm learning how to develop in C/C++/C#, Java, Python and Swift; I have experience in tools like Unity, VisualStudioCode, Xcode and CoreML. 

🥰🍿 I'm interested in animals, sports and discover new things.
