                                   **Hey, I'm Maria Gabriella Sica**


• I'm currently enrolled at Apple Developer Academy and at the University of Naples federico II, robotics engineering.

The experience at the Apple Devloper Academy trained me from a human and professional point of view, allowing me to apply the notions studied at the university, and it gave me basics of design, 
problem solving skills and team building.

• I'm learning how to develop in C/C++/C#, Java, Python and Swift; I have experience in tools like Unity, VisualStudioCode, Xcode and CoreML. 

• If you want to reach me mariagabriellasica@icloud.com.
